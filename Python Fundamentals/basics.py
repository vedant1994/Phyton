# Rules of defining a variable in python
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore(_).
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different)
#Avoid using python keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as variable names
